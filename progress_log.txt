14.04 Report

Since the last report I have done alot. The project is now at the stage where the functionality is son done and all that remains is some small visual and
interactivity features.
I have changed the plans so I now will have one setup page and one stock screener page
There are a lot of small details that I have to figure out but having fun with the project at the moment!
